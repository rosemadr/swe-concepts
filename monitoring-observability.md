# monitoring-observability 

Monitoring primarily focuses on predfined metrics and thresholds to stract system performance. It is reactive - idenitfying issues after they occur.

Observability goes beyond monitoring allowing you to infer the internal state of a system based on its outputs - typically metrics, events, logs and traces (MELTs). It is proactive, allowing you to identify issues before they impact users.

You can consider monitoring to be a technique used by observability.
